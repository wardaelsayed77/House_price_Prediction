# House_price_Prediction
🏠 House Price Prediction
📌 Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes.
It uses machine learning techniques to train and evaluate models for accurate price prediction.

📂 Dataset
File: bengaluru_house_prices.csv

Source: Real estate dataset containing features such as:

location

size (BHK)

total_sqft

bath

price

Data preprocessing steps include:

Removing null values

Handling outliers

Feature engineering (e.g., extracting numerical values from size and sqft columns)

One-hot encoding for categorical variables

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

📊 Model Training
Applied Linear Regression as baseline

Used GridSearchCV for parameter tuning

Evaluated with metrics such as:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

📈 Results
Achieved an R² score of ~0.84 on the test dataset

The model shows good generalization for unseen data

💡 Future Improvements
Add more advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost

Use cross-validation for better evaluation

Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
